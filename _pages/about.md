My name is Chun-Peng Chang from Taiwan, a graduate from RWTH Aachen with a Masterâ€™s 
degree in Media Informatics, now working as a researcher at DFKI in Kaiserslautern, Germany.
My research focuses on scene understanding and integrating text and visual data to improve
interactions between robots and humans. At DFKI, my work involves developing algorithms
that allow robots to better understand and cooperate with humans in real-time, particularly in
industrial settings.
